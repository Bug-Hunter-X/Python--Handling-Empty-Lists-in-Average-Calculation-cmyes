This repository demonstrates a common error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers:  handling the case of an empty input list. The original code returns 0, which can mask errors. The solution shows a more robust approach to handle this edge case. The provided solution demonstrates alternative approaches to deal with this scenario. The goal is to illustrate different ways of handling empty inputs for improved code reliability and exception management.
